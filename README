A basic Private Message replay module for ZNC.

This will store all private messages to & from the user.
When a new client connects the messages will be replayed.

At the moment, messages from the user will be shown as "from"
the other user, but will have "me:" prepended on them.

This was hacked together in a couple of hours and needs a lot of work.
***No one else should really use this at the moment.***
